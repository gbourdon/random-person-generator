# Random Person Generator

Have you ever wanted a random person generated out of thin air?

Well now you can!

## Where did you get the names from

For the first names, I used the [SSA's helpful website](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/decades/century.html "Top Names Over the Last 100 Years").
The last names were extracted [from here](https://names.mongabay.com/most_common_surnames.htm "List of the 1000 Most Common Surnames in the U.S. ").
